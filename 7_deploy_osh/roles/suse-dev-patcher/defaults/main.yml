# Following configuration is defined per gerrit review site.
# Review site need to support unauthenticated access via its REST API.
# Right now, only review.openstack.org is used and REST APIs are used to
# identify latest patchset of a review.

# On a per-repo basis, you may specify a list of patchsets to apply by
# the review number in the URL. There is no need to specify the revision
# as the latest revision of the patchset will always be chosen.

# Do check, repo specific frozen commit-id if used. Review patches should
# be in review (not merged) at that commit time. If those reviews, merged
# later to master, then they will be still applied to related repo to keep
# code in consistent state. In case of master revision is used, those review
# patches are not applied once its merged to master.
