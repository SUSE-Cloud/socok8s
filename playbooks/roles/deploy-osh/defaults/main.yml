# These variables were created to provide a way for deployers to
# override the default registry, for example to point to a local
# registry. This change will apply to all the charts value files by
# default, as all our own value files are including a common file
# (files/common-images-overrides.yml) making use of those variables.
# Check the variables there.
# For the registry case, the local registry should still have the same
# groups as upstream registry (kolla, openstackhelm), and the same image names.
# For versions, use suse_osh_image_version for a global OpenStack version change
# accross all images (as it is defined in common-images-overrides which is
# included in all the places).
# For a more surgical per component approach, use service overrides, like
# suse_osh_deploy_cinder_yaml_overrides for cinder for example.
