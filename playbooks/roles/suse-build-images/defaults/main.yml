#########################
# DEVELOPER EXPLANATION #
#########################

# This should be a list of what to build, and what argument you
# pass to each build. See also this structure:
# https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul-jobs/roles.html#role-build-docker-image
# Full story on how to use this:
# 0) Set developer mode. It should be already like this if you're entering
#    this role.
# 1) Override this variable by providing a `docker_images`
# variable in your ${WORKDIR}/env/extravars. That will be used for building
# its image, locally.
# 2) This role will build the docker_images listed locally, and tag them
#    with the `tags` given in here.
# 3) This role will publish the images to your local registry, provided
#    by the `repository` element in each of the docker_images item.
# 4) To use this built image in OSH, you need to pass the image in value overrides.
#    For that, check the appropriate override variable for the helm deploy step
#    for example, memcached takes a `suse_osh_deploy_memcached_yaml_overrides`,
#    which can be used to give a specific image to the memcached chart.
#    Custom override for this variable should also go to ${WORKDIR}/env/extravars.
# 5) When this is working in your local environment, provide upstream patches in
#    openstack-helm-images, and if necessary, in OSH/LOCI/OSH-infra/OSH-addons.
# 6) When those patches are up, please submit a PR in this repo (socok8s)
#    This PR should contain:
#    - the dev-patcher upstream changes to consume
#    - the eventual changes in docker_images defaults, should the docker images
#      in OSH-images not be published yet (with a link to the PR/comment on what
#      to track)
#    - the eventual changes in our deploy-osh role to point to the new
#      published image name, or alternatively (if not published) point
#      conditionally to the local built image when developer mode is enabled.
# In the future, when we'll do SLE image building...
# 1) Follow the same process 1-4, just pass an additional argument to provide a
#    different FROM image.
# 2) When this is working in your local environment, build images in IBS
#    using the same Dockerfile.
# 3) Wait for publication of said dockerfile into suse registries
# 4) Provide a PR to override the default image in deploy-osh.
# Please note this ^ only applies to dockerfiles.
# The LOCI image building (a stop gap to be more compatible with ubuntu),
# will be using different variables, and follow the usual LOCI build process
# It will only be done on openSUSE Leap 15.

## ${WORKDIR}/env/extravars example for libvirt building.

#registry_location: "$USER-osh.openstack.local:5000/"
#docker_images:
#  - context: libvirt
#    dockerfile: <custom dockerfile used for testing>
#    repository: "{{ registry_location }}openstackhelm/libvirt"
#    tags:
#      - latest-opensuse_15
## that would require overriding the libvirt chart values
# images:
#   tags:
#     libvirt: "{{ build_registry }}openstack/libvirt:latest-opensuse_15"
## Which is possible by passing an override file to the libvirt shell script
## happening in deploy-osh. That override file is generated using
## config_template and passed as /tmp/socok8s-libvirt.yaml.
## This config_template takes the _cmpnt_override named:
## ``suse_osh_deploy_libvirt_yaml_overrides``.
## Therefore the following should be set in your extravars:
# suse_osh_deploy_libvirt_yaml_overrides:
#   images:
#     tags:
#       libvirt: "{{ registry_location }}openstackhelm/libvirt:latest-opensuse_15"

# This is the default dockerfile name in OSH images for leap15/SLE15 images.
